## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates **advanced sales forecasting** using a three-year daily sales dataset. The workflow includes:  
1. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** â€“ handling missing values, trends, and seasonality.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ visualizing trends, peaks, anomalies, and patterns.  
3. **Time Series Forecasting** â€“ building hybrid models with **Prophet & ARIMA** for accurate daily sales predictions.  
4. **Interactive Visualizations** â€“ using Plotly and Seaborn to display trends and forecasts.  
5. **Automated Forecast Pipeline** â€“ export forecasts for integration into dashboards or business tools.
